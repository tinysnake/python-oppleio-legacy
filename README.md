## Statement
This is a fork repo from [jedmeng/python-oppleio](https://github.com/jedmeng/python-oppleio), since the origin author is [not active](https://github.com/jedmeng/python-oppleio/issues/3) for a long time.


I'm not a skilled python programmer, and I know nothing about reverse engineering the protocol. What I'm doing now is just to make this library continue working with the newer version of home-assistant. 

Please don't upgrade the firmware of your Opple lights, and I'm not going to development this library to communicate with the newer firmwares.

I'll keep on maintain this repo as long as I still have Opple light's in my home.

You can read the OLD_README.md for more information.

## Why there's a "legacy" term in the library name?

As far as I know, this library don't suppport newer version of Opple light's WiFi firmware, so this is just for old models, that why I add legacy to this library.
But this repo is a continue support of the original repo though.
